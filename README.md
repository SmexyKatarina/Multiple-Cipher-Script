# Multiple-Cipher-Script
 This is a resource that can be used that will allow you to encrypt/decrypt messages in different ciphers.
 
# The Script
 The script will include the following (may change in the future due to new features):
 - An encryption and decryption out of the list of ciphers (see list below).
 - A full documentation on each method in-case that some information isn't clear.
 - The script will also include a possible way of logging the outputs of each of the messages. Will only appear in Unity for current type of logging.
 - On top of the logging, the logging tag can also be customized.

# Suggestions for new ciphers?
 Definitely! Suggest them under [issues](https://github.com/SmexyKatarina/Multiple-Cipher-Script/issues). I don't know when I will be able to get to all of the suggestions, but 
 I will try my best to handle all of them. Re-posting your suggestion or someone elses suggestion will result it in getting close due to being a duplicate.
 
# Extra Information
 All of the ciphers will also have a dedicated Wiki page on this repository! So, you can go ahead and go to the [wiki here!]()
 The information that is on here will assist you on being able to do the cipher manually without the need of the script.
